Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.

Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? It's not personal. It's business. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.
